## Prerequisites

This project relies on a Node.js API app for its contents.

Clone the [beanysaya-api](https://github.com/michaeljarizala/beanysaya-api) project here and kinly set it up first.


# INSTALLATION

```
$ yarn install
```


# STARTING

Make sure to run the Node.js app on port `3001`. You may choose to setup an environment variable for this but you will need to update the code to change the static pointing of port 3001 to your env variable. Otherwise, you should be ready to go.

```
$ yarn start
```
